# Draggz-Chrome-Extension-Drag-Drop

Dragg'z is a Chrome extension that gives users an easy way to modify 
the structure of web pages by dragging and dropping DOM elements.

Changes are persisted to a remote database enabling users to share their
modifications.

### Technologies used

Dragg'z uses the Google Chrome API to interface with websites and 
Interact.js to enable the drag and drop functionality.

jQuery ajax requests send site modifications to a MongoDb back end.

The design and functionality of the extension pop-up was implemented with
Angular JS for its dynamic HTML interaction.
